# ============================================================
# WORKFLOW REPOSITORY
#
# FIX [9]: get_workflow() was using repo.transaction() for a
# SELECT. transaction() issues BEGIN ... COMMIT around every
# call. For writes this is correct and required. For reads it
# is wrong — it acquires an unnecessary write lock in SQLite's
# default journal mode, which blocks concurrent writes from
# the orchestrator's main loop.
#
# The orchestrator calls get_workflow() after every stage to
# check if the workflow was reset to 'created' status. This
# happens inside the same run loop that is also writing stage
# and execution attempt records. Wrapping the read in a
# transaction held a lock that could prevent those writes from
# proceeding cleanly.
#
# Fix: get_workflow() now uses repo.fetch_one() — the correct
# read path used by every other read in the codebase.
# All write functions (create, update_status, update_stage)
# correctly retain repo.transaction().
